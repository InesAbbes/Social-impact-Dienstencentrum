# Social-impact-Dienstencentrum
# Site:
The site i am forced to enhance is : https://www.terengelen.be/
Its an ugly and way too "crowded" site.

# Start
I started gathering the core information of the site, saving it on my local

# Resultat
I am proud to present the new website for this Dienstencentrum. i think it is very lean and it looks more attractive.
The new site can be found on my Github (repo:Social-impact-Dienstencentrum ) or via this link:https://inesabbes.github.io/Social-impact-Dienstencentrum/index.html

# Enhancement  process.
At first i Don't used a template found on this site,  i wil more challenge .
So then I started building the website from scratch, using only a little bit of Bootstrap's Frameworks.
